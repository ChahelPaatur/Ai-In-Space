# The Effectiveness of AI in Space Systems vs. Classical Computing Methods for Autonomous Fault Detection and Recovery

## Abstract

The increasing complexity and operational distance of modern space missions necessitate enhanced onboard autonomy, particularly for Fault Detection, Identification, and Recovery (FDIR). Traditional FDIR systems, often reliant on pre-defined rules and ground intervention, face limitations in handling unforeseen anomalies and significant communication latencies inherent in deep-space exploration. This research proposes investigating the efficacy of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as a paradigm for enabling fully autonomous FDIR capabilities in spacecraft. We aim to develop and compare a DRL-based FDIR agent against established classical FDIR techniques within a high-fidelity simulated spacecraft environment. Key performance indicators will include detection accuracy, recovery timeliness, robustness to novel faults, and overall mission resilience under various operational and fault scenarios, including communication constraints. This work seeks to quantify the advantages offered by DRL in advancing spacecraft autonomy for challenging mission profiles.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context: The Imperative for Spacecraft Autonomy

Contemporary and future space exploration endeavors, ranging from large-scale satellite constellations in Earth orbit to long-duration missions in deep space, impose stringent demands on spacecraft operational independence. Missions to Mars and beyond encounter communication delays rendering real-time ground control infeasible, while complex orbital platforms require rapid, localized responses to maintain operational integrity and safety. This operational landscape underscores the critical need for advanced onboard autonomy, allowing spacecraft to independently manage nominal operations, detect anomalies, diagnose root causes, and execute corrective actions to ensure mission success and platform survivability.

### 1.2 Problem: Limitations of Classical FDIR

Classical FDIR systems have been foundational to space mission success for decades. These systems typically rely on limit checking, trend analysis, predefined rule-based systems (e.g., expert systems), or simplified model-based reasoning (MBR) approaches. While effective for anticipated failure modes, classical FDIR exhibits inherent limitations:
*   **Brittleness:** Rule-based systems struggle with novel, unforeseen fault conditions or complex interacting failures not explicitly encoded in their knowledge base.
*   **Scalability:** As system complexity grows, manually defining exhaustive rules or accurate diagnostic models becomes intractable.
*   **Adaptability:** Classical systems often lack the capacity to adapt FDIR strategies based on changing operational contexts, component degradation, or environmental variations without significant ground intervention and software updates.
*   **Latency Dependence:** Many traditional architectures implicitly rely on ground support for complex diagnoses or recovery planning, a dependency incompatible with communication-constrained scenarios.

### 1.3 Proposed Solution: DRL for Autonomous FDIR

Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), offers a promising alternative to overcome the limitations of classical FDIR. DRL agents learn optimal decision-making policies through interaction with an environment (or a simulation thereof), guided by a reward signal. By combining deep neural networks for state representation and function approximation with reinforcement learning algorithms, DRL can potentially:
*   Learn complex patterns and correlations in high-dimensional telemetry data for anomaly detection.
*   Develop sophisticated diagnostic and recovery strategies directly from interaction experience, potentially discovering solutions beyond human-designed rules.
*   Adapt policies online or offline based on new data or changing system dynamics.
*   Operate autonomously, making real-time decisions onboard even under communication blackouts.

### 1.4 Research Question and Scope

This research directly addresses the question: *How does the effectiveness (quantified by detection accuracy, recovery time, computational overhead, and mission success rate under faults) of a DRL-based autonomous FDIR system compare to representative classical FDIR approaches within a simulated spacecraft environment?*

The scope will focus on:
*   Simulation of critical spacecraft subsystems (e.g., Electrical Power System (EPS), Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), Thermal Control System (TCS)).
*   Implementation of realistic fault injection scenarios (sensor failures, actuator malfunctions, component degradation, radiation-induced transients).
*   Development of a DRL agent (e.g., using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)) trained within a custom OpenAI Gym-compatible spacecraft simulation.
*   Implementation of a baseline classical FDIR system (e.g., rule-based or simplified model-based) for comparative analysis.
*   Evaluation under varying conditions, including communication latency simulation.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Classical FDIR in Aerospace

Traditional FDIR techniques encompass a spectrum of methods. Limit sensing and basic logic checks form the simplest layer. Rule-based expert systems encode engineering knowledge into IF-THEN structures to diagnose specific fault signatures. Model-Based Reasoning (MBR) techniques compare observations against a system model's predictions to detect discrepancies (residuals) and isolate faults (e.g., Livingstone2, TEAMS). While MBR offers more robustness than static rules, constructing and maintaining accurate, computationally tractable models for complex spacecraft remains challenging. Furthermore, these methods often rely on predefined fault modes and struggle with unmodeled dynamics or concurrent failures.

### 2.2 AI Applications in Space Systems

AI has seen increasing adoption in various space applications, including mission planning and scheduling (e.g., EUROPA, ASPEN), autonomous navigation and guidance (e.g., AutoNav), scientific data analysis onboard (e.g., identifying transient events), and resource management. Machine learning, particularly, is used for telemetry mining, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection using supervised (e.g., SVM, Random Forests) or unsupervised (e.g., Autoencoders, PCA, Isolation Forests) methods. However, these often focus on detection rather than autonomous recovery decision-making.

### 2.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Control

DRL has revolutionized domains requiring sequential decision-making under uncertainty, such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving. Algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN), PPO, SAC, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) enable agents to learn complex control policies in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Key advantages include end-to-end learning, the ability to handle continuous spaces, and the potential for discovering non-intuitive strategies. Its application to safety-critical systems like spacecraft requires careful consideration of exploration safety, reward shaping, and policy verification.

### 2.4 AI/ML/DRL for Spacecraft FDIR

Recent research has begun exploring ML and DRL for spacecraft FDIR. Studies have applied LSTMs or Autoencoders for telemetry anomaly detection, supervised learning for fault classification, and initial DRL concepts for simplified subsystem control or recovery tasks. Challenges often cited include the need for high-fidelity simulators, the sample inefficiency of DRL, ensuring safety during learning and execution, the sim-to-real transfer problem, and the need for explainable AI (XAI) in critical systems. This research aims to build upon these foundations by developing a more comprehensive DRL-based FDIR agent capable of both detection and autonomous recovery across multiple subsystems and comparing it rigorously against classical baselines.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Simulation Environment

A high-fidelity simulation environment is paramount. We propose using Python, leveraging libraries like NumPy/SciPy for physics-based modeling and potentially SimPy for discrete-event simulation aspects.
*   **Subsystem Models:** Develop dynamic models for key subsystems (e.g., EPS: battery state-of-charge, solar array power generation, power distribution units; ADCS: reaction wheel dynamics, sensor models (star tracker, gyro, sun sensor), thruster models; TCS: thermal node modeling, heat loads, radiator/heater control). Models will incorporate noise and environmental effects (e.g., orbital mechanics, radiation).
*   **Fault Injection:** Implement a module capable of injecting a diverse range of faults with controllable timing, magnitude, and duration (e.g., sensor bias/drift/failure, actuator stuck/loss-of-effectiveness, power component shorts/opens, radiation-induced single-event upsets (SEUs), thermal runaway). Include single-point and potential cascading failure scenarios.
*   **State Representation:** The observation space for the AI agent will consist of simulated telemetry streams from the modeled subsystems (e.g., voltages, currents, temperatures, angular rates, component statuses). Careful selection and normalization of these features are crucial.
*   **Action Space:** Define a discrete or hybrid action space representing available recovery actions (e.g., switch to redundant component, reset device, enter safe mode, adjust controller parameters, isolate faulty section, modulate heater duty cycle).
*   **Reward Function:** Design a reward function that incentivizes desired FDIR behavior: large negative rewards for mission failure or critical component loss, smaller negative rewards for persistent faults or incorrect actions, positive rewards for successful fault detection and recovery, and potentially small positive rewards for maintaining nominal operation. Reward shaping will be critical to guide learning effectively.
*   **Environment Interface:** Structure the simulation within an OpenAI Gym (`gymnasium`) compatible interface (`step`, `reset`, `observation_space`, `action_space`) to facilitate standard DRL algorithm integration.

### 3.2 Classical FDIR Baseline

Implement a representative classical FDIR system for comparison. This could be:
*   **Rule-Based System:** A set of predefined `IF <condition> THEN <action>` rules based on telemetry thresholds and logical combinations, mirroring typical operational procedures.
*   **Simplified Model-Based System:** Employing basic residual generation (comparing model predictions to sensor readings) and a simple diagnostic lookup table or logic tree to map residual patterns to fault hypotheses and recovery actions. The complexity will be constrained to represent a practical, non-AI onboard system.

### 3.3 DRL Agent Implementation

*   **Algorithm Choice:** Select a suitable DRL algorithm based on the nature of the state/action space and learning requirements. PPO is often a strong candidate due to its stability and performance in continuous and discrete domains. SAC is effective for continuous control and exploration. DQN variants (e.g., Rainbow) could be used if the action space is discretized effectively. The choice will be justified based on preliminary experiments or domain characteristics.
*   **Network Architecture:** Design appropriate neural network architectures (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), potentially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) if telemetry is treated as time-series images, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs/LSTMs) to capture temporal dependencies) for the policy and value functions. Input layers will accept the state representation; output layers will produce action probabilities (policy network) or state-action values (value network).
*   **Training:** Utilize libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Training will involve running numerous simulation episodes, collecting experience (state, action, reward, next state), and updating the agent's network parameters. Address exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Employ techniques like experience replay buffers. Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, discount factor, entropy coefficient, network size) will be crucial.

### 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

Performance will be evaluated rigorously using quantitative metrics:
*   **FDIR Performance:**
    *   Detection Rate: True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR).
    *   Mean Time To Detect (MTTD).
    *   Diagnostic Accuracy: Correctly identifying the fault type/location.
    *   Mean Time To Recover (MTTR): Time from fault occurrence to system stabilization/recovery.
*   **Mission Impact:**
    *   Mission Success Rate: Percentage of simulations successfully completing objectives despite injected faults.
    *   System Downtime: Duration critical functions are unavailable.
*   **Resource Usage:**
    *   Computational Load: Training time (offline) and inference time (onboard simulation).
    *   Memory Footprint: Size of the trained model and required runtime memory.
*   **Robustness:**
    *   Performance against novel/unseen fault types.
    *   Sensitivity to sensor noise levels.
    *   Impact of simulated communication latency on performance (for scenarios where DRL might leverage occasional ground updates vs. classical systems relying more heavily on them).

Experiments will involve Monte Carlo simulations across various fault scenarios and system conditions, comparing the DRL agent against the classical baseline using these metrics. Statistical analysis will be used to determine significant performance differences.
